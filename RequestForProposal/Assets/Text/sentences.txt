You make my heart VV.
I want to VV with you in the rain.
I love the way you VV with joy.
I am happiest when we VV together.
When you VV, I'm in heaven.
It's magical the way you VV.
Your NN alone could inspire a sonnet.
I see your NN when I close my eyes.
Your NN haunts my dreams at night.
You have the most beautiful NN I've ever seen.
Your NN is one of your loveliest features.
Wars would be fought over your NN.
Your voice is as AA as a summer day.
You move like a AA swan.
My heart flutters at the thought of your AA eyes.
You are as AA as a rose.
You remind me of a AA poem.
You fill my heart with a AA song.
I think we go together like NN and NN.
Your AA NN keeps me awake at night.
Your beauty makes my NN VV.
I would VV if I never saw your NN again!
Oh how your NN VVs in the sunlight!
Together, we will make AA NN!
I would love to VV your AA NN forever.
I am amazed how you AV VV your NN.
You never cease to AV VV my NN!
To conclude, you AV VV my NN.
I will forever long to AV VV your NN.
Your NN and my NN will make AA NN together.
